## 📌 IoT-Based Industrial Information Managerial System for Industry 4.0

This project presents a smart **Industrial Information Management System** designed to meet the data-driven demands of **Industry 4.0**. The system utilizes the **ESP32 microcontroller** to acquire real-time industrial parameters from multiple industrial sensors via the **Modbus RS485 protocol**. It stores data locally on a **micro-SD card** with precise time-stamping through an **RTC module**, ensuring continuous data logging even during network failure. The ESP32 also communicates with the **ThingsBoard cloud platform** over **MQTT**, enabling remote monitoring and advanced analytics such as forecasting and predictive maintenance.
